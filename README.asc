= Building the Book

== Setting up the Machine

. Enable virtualization options for your processor if you haven't
   (e.g. Intel VT-x in your BIOS).
. Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshwindows/[OpenSSH] or
   ensure otherwise that you have an SSH client (ssh.exe) -- e.g. via Git
. Install https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox]
. Install https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant]
. Install or make sure you have installed
   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328[Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)]
. Restart your computer after installing Vagrant

== Starting a Build
*If you have ssh.exe installed via Git you need
to do this and the following command in a "`GIT bash`"*

. Open a command line window and navigate to this directory.
. Execute `vagrant up` to start the virtual Linux box for compiling the book.
   The first time, this will download and install the image, it will take
   quite some time depending on your computer's and network's
   speed.
. `vagrant ssh` into the box. Press return if you are prompted for a passphrase
  and `vagrant` if prompted for a password.
. `cd /vagrant` inside the box
. `rake` builds all variants.

You should now have the files

* `book.pdf` (PDF version)
* `book.epub` (EPUB version),
* `book.mobi` (Kindle version), and
* `book.html` (HTML version, note that this file also depends on
  the `images` directory).

in this directory.

[TIP]
====
You can build individual variants only using `rake book:pdf` etc.
====

== Stopping the Machine

If you want to shut down the virtualbox machine, `cd` into this directory and
execute `vagrant halt`.

[TIP]
====
If you don't need the box any longer, you can use
`vagrant destroy`. Note that this command does not delete the original, downloaded Linux image from your `.vagrant.d` directory.
====

== Automatic Rebuild of HTML versions

. On your host machine run
  * `gem install listen -v '~> 2.9'`
  * `gem install thor`
  * `gem install celluloid -v '~> 0.16.0'`
  * `gem install celluloid-io -v '~> 0.16.0'`

. On your host machine run `listen -r -f 0.0.0.0:4000 -d source`.
. On the guest machine run `guard -o 10.0.2.2:4000`. The IP 10.0.2.2 must be the IP of your host machine in the vagrant network. You can find it out by running `netstat -rn` in your guest machine.
. On the host machine run `npm install` to install the gulp and browser_sync and then run `gulp serve`.

These commands can also be called using `rake listen`, `rake watch` and `rake serve`, respectively.
